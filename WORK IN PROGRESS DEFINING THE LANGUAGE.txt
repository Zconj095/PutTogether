MATHEMATICS IS AN AREA OF KNOWLEDGE THAT INCLUDES SPECIFIC FIELDS OF INTEREST KNOWN AS FORMULAS
MATHEMATICS IS AN AREA OF KNOWLEDGE THAT INCLUDES SPECIFIC FIELDS OF INTEREST KNOWN AS STRUCTURES THAT HAVE MANY SIMILAR
MATHEMATICS IS AN AREA OF KNOWLEDGE THAT INCLUDES SPECIFIC FIELDS OF INTEREST KNOWN AS ASPECTS SHAPES AND SPACES IN WHICH THE SHAPES IS CONTAINED AND QUANTITIES
THERE ARE TWO METHODS TO USING CARDINALITY
METHOD ONE OF USING CARDINALITY IS TO COMPARE LISTS USING BIJECTION OR INJECTION
METHOD TWO OF USING CARDINALITY IS TO COMPARE LISTS USING NUMBERS
THE CARDINALITY OF LIST IS ALSO KNOWN AS ITS SIZE
THE CARDINALITY OF FINITE LIST IS NUMBER OF ELEMENTS
THE CARDINALITY OF INFINITE LISTS DOES BEGIN WITH DEFINING ARBITRARY LISTS THAT CAN BE USED TOGETHER
TWO SETS HAVE THE SAME CARDINALITY IF THERE EXISTS A BIJECTION THAT IS FUNCTION FROM BEGINNING TO END
INSIDE A PLANE IS COORDINATE SYSTEM THAT SPECIFIES EACH UNIQUE ORIGIN POINT BY A LIST OF NUMBER COORDINATES
EACH REFERENCE OF COORDINATE LINE IS KNOWN AS COORDINATE AXIS OF THE SYSTEM
THE POINT WHERE THE COORDINATE LINE DOES BEGIN IS KNOWN AS ITS ORIGIN POINT
THE POINT WHERE THE COORDINATE LINE DOES END IS KNOWN AS ITS ORIGIN POINT
DIMENSION CAN BE KNOWN AS THE SMALLEST NUMBER REQUIRED LEVEL OF COORDINATES REQUIRED TO LOCATE ANY ORIGIN POINT WITHIN A COORDINATE LINE
THERE IS AN KNOWN METHOD THAT CAN CALCULATE THE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS OF MASS
THERE IS AN KNOWN METHOD THAT CAN CALCULATE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO OBJECTS
THERE IS AN KNOWN METHOD THAT CAN CALCULATE THE MASS OF AN ENTITY
COMPUTER GRAPHICS USE AN THREEDIMENSIONAL COORDINATE SYSTEM TO REFERENCE OBJECTS LOCATIONS
